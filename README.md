# Privacy Wallet - Anonymous Temporary Wallets

Generate anonymous temporary wallets for private DeFi interactions. Bridge your ZCash and get untraceable wallets on any chain. No KYC, no tracking, complete privacy.

## 🔒 How Privacy Wallets Work

Simple 4-step process for maximum anonymity:

1. **Generate Wallet** - Create anonymous temporary wallet with auto-expiry
2. **Bridge ZCash** - Bridge your ZEC to NEAR then to destination chain  
3. **Export Private Key** - Get your private key to import into any wallet
4. **Use Anonymously** - Import to MetaMask, Phantom, etc. and trade privately
